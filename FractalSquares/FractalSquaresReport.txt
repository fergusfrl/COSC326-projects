Recursive.py
- This problem is intuitively recursive with smaller repeated processes of the same method
- Easy to understand and impelment
- potential for a stack overflow with higher generations


Iterative.py
- Difficult to imagine logically (compared to recursive approach)
- Difficult to implement
- No chance for stack overflow
